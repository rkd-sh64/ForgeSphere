# ForgeSphere

ForgeSphere is an **educational, client-side Web3 wallet project** built to explore how hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets work.

This project focuses on learning:
- mnemonic-based key generation
- HD derivation paths
- differences between Solana and Ethereum key derivation
- security tradeoffs of browser-based cryptography

ForgeSphere is **not a production wallet** and should not be used to store real funds.

## Features

- **HD Wallet Generation**  
  Generate deterministic wallets from mnemonic phrases.

- **Multi-Chain Support**  
  Wallet derivation for **Solana** and **Ethereum**.

- **Client-Side Cryptography**  
  All key generation happens entirely in the browser.
